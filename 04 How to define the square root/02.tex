Today's goal is to build Riemann surfaces on which inverses of polynomials $f(z)$ can be well defined.

\section{Riemann surface for $\log z$}
If we try to define $\log z$ naively using polar coordinates we get
\begin{align}
	\log (re^{i \theta}) & = \log r + i \theta
\end{align}
We have a discontinuity at $\theta = 0$ and $\theta = 2 \pi$ so we need to make a branch cut, say at $\theta = 0$, to get a well defined function. For $\theta$ varying in the range $(0,2\pi)$ we get one branch function. We get other (distinct) branches by adding multiples of $2 \pi$ to $\theta$.
\begin{align}
	\log (re^{i \theta}) & = \log r + i (\theta + 2 n \pi)
\end{align}
To create a Riemann surface on which $\log z$ is well defined we need $\Z$ many copies of $\C$, on which we make branch cuts and glue them together.




\section{Winding numbers}
In order to generalize the above situation to more complicated functions we analyze what is happening here. For this we need the notions of winding numbers.

Consider a non-constant complex differentiable function $f:\C \rightarrow \C$. Fix a point $p \in \C$ be a complex number. Let $\gamma:[0,2\pi] \rightarrow \C$ with $\gamma(0) = \gamma(2\pi)$ be an embedded loop in $\C$ (no self intersections) containing $p$ in it's interior that goes counterclockwise. We say that $\gamma$ is \textbf{sufficiently close} to $p$ if there are no points $p' \neq p$ in the interior of $\gamma$ such that $f(p) = f(p')$.

\begin{proposition}
	For all points $p \in \C$ there exists a loop $\gamma$ sufficiently close to $p$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Consider the function $g(z) = f(z) - f(p)$. The zeroes of this complex differentiable function are exactly the points $p'$ such that $f(p') = f(p)$. Complex differentiable functions have isolated zeroes and hence $p$ has a neighborhood $U$ which does not contain any other zero of $g$. Any loop $\gamma$ in $U$ is sufficiently close to $p$.
\end{proof}


\begin{definition}
	Let $\gamma$ be a loop sufficiently close to $p$. The composition $f \circ \gamma$ is a loop around $f(p)$ (not necessarily embedded). The \textbf{winding number} $w_f(p)$ is the number of counterclockwise revolutions made by $f \circ \gamma$ around $f(p')$ minus the number of clockwise revolutions.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
	Without any loss of generality assume that $p=0$ and $f(p) = 0$. Let $\gamma(t)$  be a loop sufficiently close to $p$ then the winding number is given by
	\begin{align}
		\label{eq:winding}
		w_f(0) & = \dfrac{\log(f ( \gamma(2 \pi))) - \log(f ( \gamma(0)))}{2 \pi i}
	\end{align}
	where $\log(z)$ is any branch of the logarithm.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	For every single counterclockwise revolution $\log(z)$ increases by $2 \pi i$ and for every single counterclockwise revolution $\log(z)$ decreases by $ 2 \pi i$. The result follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
	For the function $f(z) = z^n$ the winding number around 0 is $n$ and the winding number around $p \neq 0$ is 1.
\end{example}



\subsection{Points with winding number $> 1$}
For the function $z^n$ the only complex number $z$ for which the winding number is bigger than 1 is $z=0$ and this is the point where we've to make a branch cut. This suggests that to define inverses of more complicated functions we need to figure out the points at which the winding number is greater than 1.

Let $f(z)$ be a complex differentiable function. Consider a point $p \in \C$ and let $f(z) = \sum \limits_{i=0}^\infty a_i (z-p)^i$ be the Taylor series of near $p$.

\begin{proposition}
	\label{thm:windingNum}
	The winding number of $w_f(p)$ is the smallest non-zero integer $i$ such that $a_i \neq 0$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	By shifting origin if necessary assume that $p=0$ and $f(p) = 0$ so that the Taylor expansion looks like $$f(z) = \sum \limits_{i=n}^\infty a_i z^i = z^n \sum \limits_{i=n}^\infty a_i z^{i-n} = z^n g(z) $$ for some $n > 0$ where $a_n \neq 0$ and $g(z) = \sum \limits_{i=n}^\infty a_i z^{i-n}$. The function $g(z)$ has the property that $g(0) \neq 0$. If we choose a loop $\gamma$ sufficiently close to $0$ such that $g(\gamma(t))$ stays very close to $g(0)$ then $g(z)$ is almost constant non-zero number and hence the winding number $w_f(p) = w_{z^n}(p)$ which equals $n$.
\end{proof}

With this proposition the points with winding number bigger than 1 are easily determined.
\begin{cor}
	$w_f(p) > 1$ iff $f'(p) = 0$ i.e. the points with winding number bigger than 1 are exactly the critical points of $f$.
\end{cor}


\section{Covering spaces}
Consider the function $f(z) = z^n$. For any non-zero $p$ the set $f^{-1}(p)$ contains exactly $n$ elements $p_1, \cdots, p_n$. More is true, there exists a neighborhood $U \ni p$ such that $f^{-1}(U)$ is isomorphic to $n$ non-intersecting neighborhoods of the $n$ points $U_1 \ni p_1, \cdots, U_n \ni p_n$. Furthermore the restriction of the map $f|_{U_i}$ is an isomorphism\footnote{homeomorphism}. These properties define what is called a covering space.

\begin{definition}
	A map $p: X \rightarrow Y$ is a \textbf{covering map} if for every point $y \in Y$ there exists a neighborhood $U \ni y$ such that
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $p^{-1}(U)$ is a disjoint union of subsets $\{ V_i \}_{i \in I}$ of $X$ for some indexing set $I$
		\item The restriction $p|_{V_i} : V_i \rightarrow U$ is an isomorphism for each $i \in I$.
	\end{enumerate}
	$X$ is called a \textbf{covering space} of $Y$.\\
\end{definition}

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ccc}
		\includegraphics[width=0.35\linewidth]{images/covering_space} & $\qquad \qquad$ &
		\includegraphics[width=0.25\linewidth]{images/branched_covering_space} \\
		$\qquad \qquad \qquad$ Covering Space                         &                 & Branched Covering Space
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}


So the map $z^n : \C \setminus \{ 0\} \rightarrow \C \setminus \{ 0 \}$ is a covering map. A map which is a covering map at all points except some isolate ones is called a \textbf{branched covering}. So $z^n: \C \rightarrow \C$ is a branched covering.

More generally every complex differentiable function $f(z):\C \rightarrow \C$ is a branched covering and it's restriction to the complement of critical points of $f(z)$ is a covering map.

\subsection{Monodromy}
Consider again the function $z^n: \C \rightarrow \C$. Consider a loop around the origin in the \textbf{target} complex plane passing through $z=1$. If we traverse the loop once and try to lift the loop back up to the domain $z$ then the loop does not remain a loop but becomes a path connecting 1 to the root of unity $e^{2 \pi i/n}$. In this we say that the covering $z^n$ has non-trivial \textbf{monodromy}. Monodromy is the mathematical reason why need to glue complex planes to create Riemann surfaces.\footnote{There is in fact a monodromy group that is acting upon the various sheets via permuting them.}



\subsection{Constructing the Riemann surface}

So the strategy to define the inverse of a polynomial $f(z)$ is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find the critical points of $f(z)$
	\item On the non-critical points $f(z)$ is a covering map, find the number of \emph{sheets} over each point using winding numbers
	\item Make branch cuts at each critical point and glue the sheets of complex plane to get a Riemann surface.
\end{enumerate}




\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}
	Show that the winding number of $f(z) = z^n$ at $p \in \C$ is equal to
	\begin{align}

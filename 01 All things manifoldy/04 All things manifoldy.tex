It's unfair to say that mathematicians aren't real doctors, we perform surgeries all the time. In this class we'll introduce the notion of a topological manifold via simplicial (delta) complexes. Spend a day or two doing examples and go over several notions like orientation, cobordism and of course surgery.

Keywords: simplicial complex, manifold, orientation, cobordism, surgery

\section{Orientation of surfaces}
Let us start with surfaces. A surface is called orientable if has two sides. A sphere or a torus are easily seen to be orientable. In fact any surface that can be \textit{embedded} in $\R^3$ is orientable. A Mobius strip on the other hand (which is not a surface as it has a boundary) is not orientable. With a little more mental effort one might be able to see that a Klein bottle or a Projective space are not orientable. We want an equivalent definition which can be used on gluing diagrams.

We begin by defining orientation of a polygon. An \textbf{orientation of a polygon} is simply a cyclic ordering of it's vertices. For example this is one of the two possible ways to orient a triangle with vertices $(0,1,2)$.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{c}
		\centering \includegraphics[height=3cm]{../noImageAvailable}
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{exercise}
	This is related to the fact that the polygon has two sides via the right hand rule in physics. Do you see the connection?
\end{exercise}

An \textbf{orientation} of (a gluing diagram of) a surface is a compatible choice of orientation for each triangle, where the orientations of two adjacent triangles need to be compatible in the following way,
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{c c c}
		\centering \includegraphics[height=3cm]{../noImageAvailable} & \: & \centering \includegraphics[height=3cm]{../noImageAvailable}
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
This forces an edge to be directed in two different directions in adjacent triangles.

\begin{exercise}
	Add the diagonals to the standard gluing diagrams to obtain triangulations and try to find orientations for them. Conclude that $S^2,T$ are orientable and $\R\P^2,K$ are not.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
	Use gluing diagrams to show that $T\#T$ is orientable. Generalize this to argue that $T ^{\# n}$ are orientable.
\end{exercise}

This same method also allows us to understand manifolds in higher dimensions as well.







\section{Simplices}
As we go to higher dimensions polygons (or is it polytopes?) become whacky are themselves quite hard to understand. So instead of looking at arbitrary polygons we look at the simplest polygons: triangles. We'll upgrade the definition of a triangle to a simplex which can live in arbitrary dimensions.

\begin{definition}
	An $n$ dimensional \textbf{simplex} $\Delta^n$ is any set which is homeomorphic to the following region in $\R^{n}$.
	\begin{align}
		\{ (x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_n) : x_0 + \cdots + x_n \le 1 \mbox{ and each } x_i \ge 0  \}
	\end{align}
\end{definition}
A 1 dimensional simplex is a segment and a 2 dimensional simplex is a triangle.
Simplices are topologists best friend.

Note that by adding extra diagonal lines we could have made the gluing diagrams entirely out of triangles.
We represent a simplex by its set of vertices.

\end{figure}

As with origami you can glue these simplices any way you want and get relaly interesting objects. We're going to glue them to create manifolds.

\section{Manifolds from simplices}
A delta complex is a collection of simplices glued along the faces.
